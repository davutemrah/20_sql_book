## Order of Execution

1. `FROM` clause

SQL begins by identifying and combining all relevant data from the specified tables. This includes any joins or subqueries. The `FROM` clause defines the data source and sets the foundation for the rest of the query.


2. `JOIN` clause

If there are any `JOIN` clauses, SQL processes them immediately after identifying the tables in the `FROM` clause. The joining of tables determines which rows from the combined tables are considered for further steps.


3. `WHERE` clause

After combining tables, SQL applies the `WHERE` clause to filter out rows that do not meet the criteria. The result is a reduced dataset that satisfies the condition(s).


4. `GROUP BY` clause

SQL groups the filtered rows based on the columns specified in the `GROUP BY` clause. This is necessary for aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.


5. `HAVING` or `QUALIFY` clause

- After the `GROUP BY` clause, SQL applies the `HAVING` clause to filter the grouped results. Unlike `WHERE`, which filters rows before grouping, `HAVING` filters groups after they have been formed.


- The window functions like `RANK()` are executed before filtering by `QUALIFY.` The `QUALIFY` clause then filters based on the results of these window functions.


- `SELECT` After `QUALIFY`: The `SELECT` clause is applied last, selecting the columns from the result set after the filtering is done by `QUALIFY.`



6. `SELECT` clause

SQL evaluates the `SELECT` clause after all filtering, grouping, and having conditions have been applied. It determines which columns or expressions are included in the final output.



7. `DISTINCT` clause

SQL applies the `DISTINCT` clause after the `SELECT` clause, ensuring that only unique rows are returned.



8. `ORDER BY` clause

SQL orders the final result set according to the columns specified in the `ORDER BY` clause. This is the last step in query execution before the result set is returned.



9. `LIMIT` - `OFFSET` - `TOP`

SQL applies these clauses after all other operations have been completed. `LIMIT` defines how many rows to return, while `OFFSET` skips a specified number of rows.
