## LATERAL

This SQL query involves a few advanced concepts, including the use of the LATERAL join and the FLATTEN function, which are specific to certain SQL platforms like Snowflake. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the query:

`ID_ARRAY`:  LIST OF IDS IN EACH ROW


`FLATTEN` function is used to "unpack" or "expand" the ID_ARRAY column into individual elements. Essentially, it takes an array and returns each element in the array as a separate row.

```sql
SELECT F.MY_ID::VARCHAR AS MY_ID
FROM TABLE_1 A,  LATERAL FLATTEN(A.ID_ARRAY) AS F
```
